<h1> HashBROWNS: Emolock </h1>
<div>

## About
-------------------
The emolock is an emotion-controlled lock system in Python and C, which allows a predetermined set of emotions (eg. happy-angry-happy-surprised in that specific order) to act as the unlock password. Our Logitech USB camera is set up to capture facial expressions, which is processed by the computer back end. The arduino is coded to control the automatic locking and unlocking of a solenoid electromagnetic cabinet lock. Anyone with knowledge of this password is able to gain access to the cabinet. 

## Passward Logic
-------------------
1. The password is pre-set and at the moment, does not allow custom changes
2. It will be a combination of 4 emotions
3. Emotion library: happy, angry, surprised
4. Consecutive repeating emotions (e.g. happy-happy) is not allowed
